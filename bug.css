The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes the results are unexpected due to the order of operations or incorrect unit usage. For example, if you try to subtract a percentage from a pixel value directly, it may not work as expected.  Another issue can occur with nested `calc()` expressions, leading to unexpected results if the parentheses aren't properly balanced or if the units within the nested expressions are inconsistent.
